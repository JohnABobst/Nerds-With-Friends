# Nerds-With-Friends
A program uses random words to create the name of a Magic the Gathering card.  Then users can input what they think the card would be i.e (Casting cost, card type, rules text, flavor text).  A judge is chosen each round to pick the best entry.  A different user judges each round.  Whoever is judging doesn't submit an entry.  The user whose card was chosen gets a point for that round.  The game ends when all rounds have been completed.  Users specify the amount of rounds, time limit for submitting entries, and when the game starts.  Player with the most points wins.
